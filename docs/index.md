</section>

## Technologies

Apl√≥e is meant to be quick and easy, that's why it's built for Vue.js 3 projects with Vite. The project is build with TypeScript, and it's optimized for [Vue I18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-i18n) for translations. The design is based on the Apl√≥s theme, and it uses the Inter font for text and Geist Mono for code snippets.

The project is also designed to be mobile-friendly, with a responsive design that works on any device.

## Configuration

Apl√≥e is designed to be as easy to use as possible, with a simple configuration that can be easily customized. Each project based on Apl√≥e will provide an `.env.aploe` file where the basic configuration will be stored.

**It's currently not implemented, but it's planned for the future, as the project is still in development.**

## Documentation

Apl√≥e is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and clean documentation that explains how to use the components and styles provided by the project. The documentation is available below.

### Structure

Apl√≥e offers a wide range of customizable components. With just a single element, you can easily customize these components to suit your needs. Here's an example:

```vue
<CarData
  title="livecars.title"
  description="livecars.desc"
  icon="globe"
  api="https://api.example.org:1234/api/get_cars"
  fallback="1000"
  background="#c0e2de83"
  iconColor="green"
  translations="true"
/>
```

The example above is a simple component that displays specific content from an API. There are also other components, such as `ExternalLink` that is an component with a link to an page/website, like this:

```vue
<ExternalLink
  title="external.title"
  description="external.desc"
  link="https://example.org/"
  icon="globe"
  background="#c0e2de83"
  iconColor="green"
  translations="true"
/>
```

All elements are designed for easy translation, with the `title` and `description` being connected to the `vue-i18n` library.

More complex components, such as the Header, Footer and other provide slots for more customization, but the basic structure is the same.

### Translations

Apl√≥e is designed to be easily translated into any language using Vue I18n. But, it's optional, by setting `translations` to `false` in the component, you can disable translations for that specific component. Here's an example:

```vue
<ExternalLink
  title="External Link"
  description="This is an external link"
  link="https://example.org/"
  icon="globe"
  background="#c0e2de83"
  iconColor="green"
  translations="false"
/>
```

The example above disables translations for the `ExternalLink` component. In the future, there will be a setting to disable translations for the entire project.

### Component Glossary

- **Data** - A component that displays specific content from an API. It's also enquipped with a title, description, icon, background and icon color. It also has a fallback value, in case the API is down.\*

- **ExternalLink** - A component with a link to an page/website. It's also enquipped with a title, description, icon, background and icon color. The `link` is the URL to the page/website. It also supports Vue Router links, by using the `is-router-link` boolean.\*

- **Header** - A component that displays the header of the page. It's also enquipped with a title, description, icon, background and icon color. It also has a slot for the navigation links, dropdowns and other elements.\*

  - **ExtraInfo** - A component that displays extra information in the header. Just a slot.

- **Faq** - A component that displays a list of frequently asked questions. It's also enquipped with a title, description, icon, background and icon color. It also has a slot for the questions and answers.\*

  - **FaqItem** - A component that displays a single question and answer. It's also enquipped with a title and content.\*

- **Features** - A component that displays a list of features. It's also enquipped with a title, description, icon, background and icon color. It also has a slot for the features.\*

  - **Benefit** - A component that displays a single feature. It's also enquipped with a title and a slot for content.\*

- **Content** - A component that displays any content. It's also enquipped with a title, description, icon, background and icon color. It also has a slot for the content.\*

* - Has a boolean to enable/disable translations.

## Design

By it's words, Apl√≥e includes a design language, following specific styles to make the page as unified as possible. The goal of the framework is to make it as adaptive and easy to read on any devices, making sure that anyone can access the information from anywhere in the world. That's also why translation are such a big part of the project. To make the design work, much of the basic styles were taken from [Apl√≥s](https://aplos.gxbs.me), the VitePress theme. With that creating simple blend cards as elements to create a visually appiling for of an website.

## Template

Apl√≥e is still in heavy development, once it's mature enough, and gets a stable release, a template will be created to make it easier to start a project with Apl√≥e. The template will include all the necessary files and configurations to start a project with Apl√≥e, and it will be easy to customize and extend. The template will also include a basic example of how to use the components and styles provided by Apl√≥e. More information about the template will be provided once it's ready.

### Roadmap

- [x] Create the basic structure of the project.
- [x] Create the basic components.
- [x] Create the basic styles.
- [x] Make translations optional.
- [x] Remove all junk styles and classes.
- [x] Support Dark Mode.
- [x] Create a documentation for the project.

~~When all of the above tasks are completed, the project will get the release candidate status, and it will be ready for the first stable release.~~

The project is now in the release candidate status, and it's preparing for the first stable release. The project is now in the `1.0.0-rc.1` version.

### Future Plans

- [ ] Create configuration file for the project. (It requires a lot of effort, so `2.0.0` is planned for this feature.)
- [ ] Create a template for the project. (A template isn't necessary for how the project currently works, it's too simple, once a configuration file is added, a template will be needed.)
