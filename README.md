## Technologies

Apl贸e is meant to be fast and quick, that's why it's built with Vue.js 3 and Vite 5. Outside the main 2 technologies, `vue-i18n`, `typescript`, `pnpm`, and many others are used to achieve this project.

## Structure

Apl贸e has a Component-Based Architecture ensuring that it can be as low maintenance as possible. Many of the components can be easily edited with one line, like so:

```vue
<CarData
  title="livecars.title"
  description="livecars.desc"
  icon="globe"
  api="https://api.example.org:12345/api/get_cars"
  fallback="1000"
  background="#c0e2de83"
  iconColor="green"
/>
```

## Design

By it's words, Apl贸e is a design language, following specific styles to make the page as unified as possible. The goal of the framework is to make it as adaptive and easy to read on any devices, making sure that anyone can access the information from anywhere in the world. That's also why translation are such a big part of the project. To make the design work, much of the basic styles were taken from [Aplos](https://aplos.gxbs.me), the VitePress theme. With that creating simple blend cards as elements to create a visually appiling for of an website.
